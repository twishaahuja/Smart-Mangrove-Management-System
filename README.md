## LY PROJECT

## Abstract
The Smart Mangrove Management project integrates GIS mapping, AI analysis, and chatbot assistance to support the conservation of mangroves, focusing on the Mumbai region. By leveraging Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, the GIS module generates high-resolution maps of mangrove distributions, providing a visual basis for monitoring spatial changes. The AI component employs vegetation indices, such as NDVI, to assess and predict mangrove health, offering valuable insights for proactive conservation. Additionally, an LLM-powered chatbot enables real-time interactions, allowing users to access mangrove data and conservation advice seamlessly. Together, these modules form a comprehensive, scalable system that enhances stakeholder engagement and facilitates data-driven, sustainable mangrove management.
